So assuming you have already installed Boringssl in Linux then go ahead  type in these lines of code.

Handshake

./bssl s_client -connect   tls13.pinterjann.is:443 -tls13-variant draft28

You need to use a TLS 1.3 compatible server or client in order to get a TLS 1.3 connection.
You can find a list of them over here:             
But also you can change the draft number.


Resumption

./bssl s_client -test-resumption -connect   tls13.pinterjann.is:443 -tls13-variant draft28

 0-RTT
 
 Unfortunetly for this one there is a Bug and it will not work so until this gets fixed, I will post a test code.
